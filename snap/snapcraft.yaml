summary: A lightweight app to help run stand-up meetings
description: |
  A lightweight Flutter desktop application that helps run efficient stand-up
  or daily-scrum meetings.

  Each participant gets a fixed countdown (default 2 min) that automatically
  advances to the next speaker when time is up.

  You can quickly include/exclude speakers and see the total expected meeting
  time before you start.
